## Description:

## Installation:

* First clone the application from GitHub to your local machine.

* Then open the command line ineterface in the ```assets``` folder.

* Next type ```npm install``` in the cammand line to download all required dependancies to your local machine.

* Once they install you'll need to type ```npm audit fix``` to update those dependancies.

* Now you are ready to type ```mysql -u root -p``` You'll need to enter your password to connect to the MySQL program on your local machine.

* Once MySQL is connected, copy the contents of db/schema.sql and paste it onto the command line after the ```mysql>``` prompt.

* Now the ```ecommerce_db``` is in place.

* Next type ```use ecommerce_db``` to connect the application to the new database.

* Now, after the ```mysql>``` prompt type ```quit``` to exit the mysql shell.

* Now you are ready to type ```npm run seed``` to populate the database.

* When that completes, you are ready to type ```npm start``` to intialize the application.

* Now you should be able to use Insomnia to test the application.

* However, this part failed for me and it's 11pm on a school night so this is a "pencils down" moment. So the application is not working and I'm out of time. I may be back to fix it but the pace of this BootCamp is such that I don't have time. Thanks for listening...
